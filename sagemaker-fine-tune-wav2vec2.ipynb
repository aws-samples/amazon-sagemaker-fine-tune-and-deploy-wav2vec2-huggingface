    "# Fine-tune and deploy Wav2Vec2 model for speech recognition with Hugging Face and SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Wav2Vec2 is a transformer-based architecture for ASR tasks and was released in September 2020. We show its simplified architecture diagram below. For more details, see the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477). The model is composed of a multi-layer convolutional network (CNN) as feature extractor, which takes input audio signal and outputs audio representations, also considered as features. They are fed into a transformer network to generate contextualized representations. This part of training can be self-supervised, it means that the transformer can be trained with a mass of unlabeled speech and learn from them. Then the model is fine-tuned on labeled data with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) algorithm for specific ASR tasks. The base model we use in this post is [Wav2Vec2-Base-960h](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h), it is fine-tuned on 960 hours of Librispeech on 16kHz sampled speech audio. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/wav2vec2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is character-based algorithm. During the training, it’s able to demarcate each character of the transcription in the speech automatically, so the time-frame alignment is not required between audio signal and transcription. For example, one audio clip says “Hello World”, we don’t need to know in which second word “hello” is located. It saves a lot of labeling effort for ASR use cases. If you are interested in how the algorithm works underneath, see [this article](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/) for more information.  \n",

    "## Notebook Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use [SUPERB \n",
    "(Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark) dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/superb) that available from Hugging Face Datasets library, and fine-tune the Wav2Vec2 model and deploy it as SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference for an ASR task. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/solution_overview.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we show how to load and preprocess the SUPERB dataset in SageMaker environment in order to obtain tokenizer and feature extractor, which are required for fine-tuning the Wav2Vec2 model. Then we use SageMaker Script Mode for training and inference steps, that allows you to define and use custom training and inference scripts and SageMaker provides supported Hugging Face framework Docker containers. For more information about training and serving Hugging Face models on SageMaker, see Use [Hugging Face with Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/hugging-face.html). This functionality is available through the development of Hugging Face [AWS Deep Learning Container (DLC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deep-learning-containers/latest/devguide/what-is-dlc.html). \n",
